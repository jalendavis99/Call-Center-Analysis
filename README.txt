python analysis_script.py
The script performs various analyses on the call center data and generates visualizations.

Features
Data Loading: Loads call center data from a CSV file using Pandas.
Data Cleaning: Removes NaN values and filters out calls with short durations.
Visualization: Creates visualizations to show call distribution, representative performance, and time-based call analysis.
Results
The analysis provides insights into call distribution, call duration, representative performance, and call patterns based on time of day.
